            Career switches can be exciting, yet daunting.  However, if you never take the leap, you will never know where life could take you outside of your comfort zone.
            I am currently a teacher, but I knew that it was time for something new.  In June 2023, I took the first leap to becoming a web developer and started classes 3 weeks later.
            In December 2023, I received my Full-Stack Web Developer certificate from Rutgers University and I have not looked back since.  During my time in school, I took
            advantage of every learning opportunity that Rutgers had to offer, including taking a course to become certified in AI.  This has helped me develop an impressive portfolio
            that displays my skills and what I can offer to your business.
